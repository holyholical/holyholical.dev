# holyholical.dev

Welcome to **holyholical.dev** – my personal portfolio

This is my professional and creative space where I showcase my projects, experiments, and work in web development, programming, and digital design.

The website is currently live at: https://holyholical.github.io/holyholical.dev/
Soon, it will be available on my own custom domain! ;)

### ✨ Fun Note

This portfolio is a living project—expect new experiments and projects to appear over time. Feel free to explore, get inspired, and reach out!
